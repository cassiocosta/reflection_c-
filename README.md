# Reflection in C# ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Reflection in C#** repository! This repository explores the powerful concept of Reflection in C#â€”a tool that allows code to inspect, create, and manipulate objects at runtime. Each example is organized into specific sections, complete with code, explanations, and practical use cases.

## Overview

Reflection in C# is a powerful technique that lets code inspect types, create instances, and invoke members of classes at runtime. It is particularly useful in scenarios where type information is unknown at compile time or when you need to create more dynamic applications. This repository provides the following resources:

- **Step-by-step examples** of using Reflection in C#
- **Detailed explanations** for each example, covering key concepts and usage
- **Common use cases** where Reflection is especially useful

## Examples

This repository contains a series of practical examples organized by topic. Each example includes a README with code explanations and guidance for running the example.

### 1. Listing Properties and Methods of a Class

**Folder:** `Examples/ListPropertiesAndMethods/`  
**Description:** Demonstrates how to use Reflection to list all properties and methods of a specified class. This example uses a `Car` class and displays each property and method name.

[Go to Example](examples/ListPropertiesAndMethods/README.md)

### 2. Dynamic Object Creation

**Folder:** `Examples/DynamicObjectCreation/`  
**Description:** Shows how to dynamically create an instance of a class using its name as a string. In this example, we create a `Car` object, set its properties, and call its methods at runtime.

[Go to Example](examples/DynamicObjectCreation/README.md)

### 3. Invoking Methods Dynamically

**Folder:** `Examples/InvokeMethodsDynamically/`  
**Description:** Illustrates how to invoke methods on an object without knowing the method name until runtime. This example shows how to invoke the `StartEngine` method on a `Car` object.

[Go to Example](examples/InvokeMethodsDynamically/README.md)

### 4. Common Use Cases

**Folder:** `Examples/UseCases/`  
**Description:** Provides examples of practical applications of Reflection, such as mapping classes to databases, dependency injection, and implementing plugin systems.

[Go to Example](examples/UseCases/README.md)
