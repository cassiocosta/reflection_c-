# Use Cases for Reflection in C#

This folder outlines various applications of Reflection in C#. Reflection allows you to inspect types, properties, and methods at runtime, providing powerful capabilities for dynamic programming.

## Applications

1. **Database Mapping**
   - Reflection can be used to map object properties to database columns dynamically. This is particularly useful in ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) where you want to automate the process of converting database records into objects.

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - It enables dynamic resolution of dependencies, allowing services to be injected at runtime. This is beneficial in scenarios where the types of dependencies may not be known at compile time, promoting loose coupling and enhancing testability.

3. **Plugins Architecture**
   - Reflection facilitates the dynamic loading and execution of plugins. This allows applications to extend their functionality without requiring recompilation, enabling users to add new features easily by simply adding new assemblies.

## Benefits of Using Reflection

- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changes in types and members without needing to modify existing code.
- **Decoupling**: Separate code from specific implementations, allowing for more modular architecture.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Create more dynamic applications that can react to types and methods that may not be known until runtime.

## Note

While Reflection is a powerful feature, it should be used judiciously as it can introduce performance overhead and complicate code readability. Ensure to balance its benefits with potential drawbacks based on your application's requirements.
